## Style Guidelines:

- Color Palette - Primary Colors: - Persian Green (#109886): A calming and vibrant green with a strong, earthy tone, representing growth, trust, and sophistication. - Goldenrod (#D9A92B): A rich, warm yellow-gold that adds a touch of luxury and brightness, evoking warmth, optimism, and creativity.- Secondary Colors:- Soft Ivory (#F8F6F2): A light, neutral background color that contrasts beautifully with your primary colors, helping to maintain readability and visual cleanliness.- Deep Charcoal (#333333): A dark, almost-black gray for text and accents, providing strong contrast and enhancing legibility while not being as harsh as pure black.- Warm Taupe (#D6B29B): A soft, muted neutral tone that can be used for subtle backgrounds or secondary elements to balance out the strong contrast of your primary colors.- Accent Colors:- Peach (#F8D7A6): A soft, pastel peach that pairs well with both Persian Green and Goldenrod, providing a lighter, playful accent without overwhelming the palette.- Cool Slate (#4C5C68): A darker blue-gray to balance out the warmer tones in the palette, offering depth to your designs.
- Typography:- Primary Font: A modern, sans-serif font (like Montserrat or Lato) for clean, readable text. Use Persian Green for headings to maintain visual hierarchy, while using Deep Charcoal for body text.- Secondary Font: A serif font (like Playfair Display) for elegant accents or quotes in Goldenrod to evoke a sense of warmth and luxury.
- Header and Footer: - Backgrounds in Persian Green for a bold, impactful start and end to your page. Use Goldenrod for call-to-action buttons or links, and Soft Ivory for the text to keep it readable and welcoming.
- Buttons and CTAs:- Use Goldenrod for prominent buttons like "Buy Now" or "Contact Us" to attract attention.- Hover state: A lighter variant of Goldenrod or a transition to Persian Green to create a sense of interactivity and maintain the brand’s vibrant, energetic feel.
- Backgrounds:- Soft Ivory should be the primary background color for most of your pages. It’s light and neutral enough to allow your brand colors to stand out. For hero sections or key moments, you can use Persian Green as the background for a strong focal point.
- Icons and illustrations should primarily use Deep Charcoal or Goldenrod to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic. For a more energetic feel, Persian Green can be incorporated into illustrations or accent details.
- Spacing and Layout:- Go for a minimalist, spacious design with plenty of white space (or Soft Ivory) to ensure clarity. Use strong, clear lines and grid systems to align content in an organized, readable manner.
- Brand Imagery:- For product images or lifestyle shots, use muted tones or natural imagery that complements the brand’s earthy, refined vibe. This ensures cohesion between the website’s color scheme and the overall brand ethos.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with an elegant, high-end feel; use 'PT Sans' for body text (sans-serif).
- Use clean and modern icons that are easily recognizable and relate to humanitarian work, education, and support.
- Ensure a clear and intuitive layout with easy navigation. Prioritize key information such as ongoing campaigns and donation options.
- Use subtle animations to highlight important information and guide the user through the website, like donation progress updates.
